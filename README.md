# Sapphire Language (Ad hoc implementation)

## Intro
(Not ready)

## Build Binary
### Windows Platform
Compile them in Visual Studio 2017 or later versions.(MSVC 14+).
Just add all source files into a new solution. You can also build them with cl.exe manually.

Notice: Mingw/Cygwin is NOT OFFICIAL SUPPORTED for now. You can post issues for these resolutions but I may not fix 
them until I start working on them.

### Linux/macOS Platform
Just use the make and cmake to build these codes.

## Help me?
You can post issues or create pull request.
